# PyGames-synthesis
A synthesizer and DSL for generating strategies for playing Catcher game.

## Dependencies

```
pillow
matplotlib
numpy
nose2
Pygame-Learning-Environment
```

## Pygame-Learning-Environment
The PyGames-Synthesis repository provides the implementation of a domain-specific language (DSL) and synthesizers such as Bottom-Up Search, Simulated Annealing and Probe.

It does **not** provide the implementation for the games on which solutions are evaluated at the moment. The games that were used to test the
DSL and the synthesizer were implemented at [Ntasfi's Pygame-Learning-Environment repository](https://github.com/ntasfi/PyGame-Learning-Environment).

### Note:

- I also used an implementation of Pong different from the one in the Pygame-Learning-Environment to test my synthesizer.
  - The reason is that Pong is a 2-player game and it can be beneficial for the search if synthesized strategies play against each other, instead of the same opponent provided by the Pygame-Learning-Environment implementation.
- Any implementation of the games in the Pygame-Learning-Environment should work with the synthesizer and the DSL if the appropriate gamestate and action set are provided in their respective Evaluation sub-classes in __src/Evaluation/__ .

## Installation

Clone this repository and [Ntasfi's Pygame-Learning-Environment repository](https://github.com/ntasfi/PyGame-Learning-Environment). Rename the __Pygame-Learning-Environment__ directory to ```pygame_games``` and move it to __PyGames-synthesis/__ . You also need to install the module dependencies of both projects. I strongly suggest that you use a virtual environment instead of installing globally.

```console
git clone https://github.com/olivier-vadiaval/PyGames-synthesis.git
git clone https://github.com/ntasfi/PyGame-Learning-Environment.git
pip install -e
```

If you want to use the synthesizer for generating strategies for the Pong domain, please contact me. You can also use a different Pong implementation as long as it implements the methods and attributes used by the game object in EvaluationPong in __src/Evaluation/evaluation_pong.py__ . That is, it should have a step method, be capable of returning a game state as a dictionary, be able to determine if the game is over and have a way to reward strategies in the game.

## Starting the Synthesizer
Run __one__ of the provided bash scripts in __bin/__ to start the synthesizer. Each bash script will run the synthesizer with a specific configuration: with and without triage, with and without optimizer and the like. 

However, the domain, the time budget and the total number of games to use during evaluation must be specified when using the ```sh``` command. 

For example, to run the synthesizer for 300 seconds (5mins) with a 20-game triage evaluation and without any optimizer for the Catcher domain, use the following command __from the root level directory (that is PyGames-synthesis/)__:

```console
sh bin/sa_no_opt_triage_eval.sh Catcher 300 20
```

Some imports might have to be fixed in the pygame_games directory. Prefix imports with ```pygame_games.``` in the relevant files for which import errors are raised. Only do this for imports from parts of the pygame_games directory. Do not prefix imports such as ```import pygame``` with ```pygame_games.```.

## Command-line Arguments

```

## DSL

The domain-specific language (DSL) that was implemented in [src/DSL.py](https://github.com/olivier-vadiaval/catcher-synthesis/blob/main/src/DSL.py) can be summarized in the
following context-free grammar (CFG):

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59672031/126842833-5827ee87-535c-458e-9583-eab5f600895f.png)

where,
* **I** is the initial symbol. 
* The A symbol provides access to an array of 3 actions.
* The D symbol provides arithmetic operations and the domain-specific functions (DSFs) through D1 and D2.
* T provides constants that can be used in the arithmetic operations.
* S1 is the production rule for potentially nested if statements and/or successive if statements.
* S2 adds if-else statements.
* S3 adds for loops to the DSL. The body of the loop can be either S1 or S2.
* B provides comparison operators.
* Îµ represents an empty string.

## Tests

Unit tests are implemented in tests/ using the unittest module in python. One can also install nose2 and run the following command in the root directory
to execute all the tests:

```console
python -m nose2
```
